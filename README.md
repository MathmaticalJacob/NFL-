Practicing Data Analytics use NFL Data

The intention behind this project is to evaluate the data and see what interesting conclusions
I could stumble upon that may not be commonly mentioned in the NFL. I personally only started watching
football the last two years, so I'm sure theres a lot I can learn from this that both enhance my capabilities 
as a data analyst and an enjoyer of the sport.
