Practicing Data Analytics use NFL Data

The intention behind this project is to evaluate the data and see what interesting conclusions
I could stumble upon that may not be commonly mentioned in the NFL. I personally only started watching
football the last two years, so I'm sure theres a lot I can learn from this that both enhance my capabilities 
as a data analyst and an enjoyer of the sport. 

After doing some research it seems most statisics from 2010 - 2020 are readily available are well documented in spreedsheets. Most likely going to use data from this time period

Need to create new database for data. Might shorten the data to work with it in excel as well.
